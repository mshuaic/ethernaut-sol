/**

 * Level address: 0x725595BA16E76ED1F6cC1e1b65A88365cC494824
 * Nowadays, paying for DeFi operations is impossible, fact.
 *
 * A group of friends discovered how to slightly decrease the cost of performing
 * multiple transactions by batching them in one transaction, so they developed
 * a smart contract for doing this.
 *
 * They needed this contract to be upgradeable in case the code contained a bug,
 * and they also wanted to prevent people from outside the group from using it.
 * To do so, they voted and assigned two people with special roles in the
 * system: The admin, which has the power of updating the logic of the smart
 * contract. The owner, which controls the whitelist of addresses allowed to use
 * the contract. The contracts were deployed, and the group was whitelisted.
 * Everyone cheered for their accomplishments against evil miners.
 *
 * Little did they know, their lunch money was at riskâ€¦
 *
 *   You'll need to hijack this wallet to become the admin of the proxy.
 *
 *   Things that might help:
 *
 * Understanding how delegatecall works and how msg.sender and msg.value behaves
 * when performing one.
 * Knowing about proxy patterns and the way they handle storage variables.
